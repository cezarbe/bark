Elea also known as: Hyele, Velia
Elea, ancient city in Lucania, Italy, about 25 miles southeast of Paestum; home of the Eleatic school of philosophers, including Parmenides and Zeno. The city was founded about 535 bc by Phocaean Greek refugees on land seized from the native Oenotrians. 

A paradox is a logical statement that leads to surprising or contradictory conclusions that conflict with expectations. 
Paradoxes of Zeno of Elea
Greek philosophers were interested in various types of paradoxes. One of them, Zeno of Elea (c. 490-430), a follower of the thought of Parmenides of Elea and a representative of the Eleatic school, as well as the creator of dialectics, a field concerned with arriving at the truth by revealing contradictions in the reasoning of opponents, dedicated himself to the study of motion.
Paradoxes of Motion
Zeno's paradoxes aimed to prove that the motion in the world we perceive is merely an illusion that is not possible in reality. 
1. Dichotomy: A runner who wants to cover a certain distance cannot even start. He must first cover half the distance to the goal, but before that, he must cover half of that half, and so on, ad infinitum. Thus, the runner will not be able to even leave the starting point.
2. Achilles and the tortoise: Achilles and the tortoise stand at the starting line of a race over any distance. Achilles can run twice as fast as the tortoise, so at the start, he allows the tortoise to get ahead. However, Achilles will never catch up to the tortoise. Whenever he reaches the point from which the tortoise started, the tortoise has already moved ahead. Each time Achilles reaches the tortoise's previous position, the tortoise is further along. Achilles can only get closer to the tortoise but will never overtake it or even match its position. 
3. The Arrow: This paradox states that an arrow shot from a bow never reaches its target. The seemingly moving arrow is actually not moving, as at every moment of its motion, it occupies a specific position, meaning it is at rest in that position. Since time consists of moments, and the arrow is at rest at every moment, it follows that it is at rest throughout the entire time. Therefore, it is impossible for the arrow to be at rest and in motion simultaneously at every moment in time.
4. The Stadium: Consider a chariot race. The speed at which the chariots move is simultaneously the same and different, lesser and greater, depending on which other chariots are being considered. If the motion occurs at a speed that is simultaneously "such and not such," then it is contradictory and cannot exist. Here is a schematic representation:
A row of chariots A is stationary, while rows B and C are moving on different tracks at the same speed in opposite directions. The relative speed at which B and C pass each other is twice that at which each of them passes A.

 The remaining paradoxes of Zeno:
1. Measure.
Zeno argues that every magnitude is divisible. This means it can be divided into increasingly smaller parts. If a magnitude is infinitely divisible, it can be divided into an infinite number of parts. Each of these parts must also have some magnitude. If these infinite parts have zero magnitude, then the whole, composed of such parts, would also have to have zero magnitude. This leads to the conclusion that something that is divisible into an infinite number of parts cannot exist as a whole. On the other hand, if these parts have finite magnitude, then the whole, composed of an infinite number of such parts, must have infinite magnitude. This also seems absurd. Thus, we arrive at a contradiction: a magnitude cannot be both devoid of magnitude and infinite.
2. Quantity.
If a multitude exists, it must be both finite and infinite in quantity. If there are as many things as there are, then their quantity should be finite. However, every two things are separated by a third, and between them are more and so on. Thus, the number of existing things is unbounded.
3. Place.
The paradox of "place" concerns the concept of place and space. Zeno argues that if everything that exists occupies some place, then that place must also have its own place, and so on, leading to infinity. This introduces a contradiction because there is no end to these places, which seems logically problematic.
4. The Heap.
The name "sorites" derives from the Greek word soros, meaning "pile" or "heap." Sorites paradoxes are exemplified by the problem that a single grain of wheat does not comprise a heap, nor do two grains of wheat, three grains of wheat, etc. However, at some point, the collection of grains becomes large enough to be called a heap, but there is apparently no definite point where this occurs. 

5. Sowing.
This paradox concerns the perception of sounds during the sowing of seeds. It assumes that when a single seed is sown, there are no auditory sensations. This leads to the conclusion that when a larger number of seeds are sown, the perceived noise must be merely an illusion. 

Zeno's paradoxes remain relevant, provoking thought about what movement and time mean. Contemporary philosophy and science still pose the questions that Zeno raised centuries ago, which makes him one of the most important thinkers in the history of philosophy.
